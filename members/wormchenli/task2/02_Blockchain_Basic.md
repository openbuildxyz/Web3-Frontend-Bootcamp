## [简答题] 简述区块链的网络结构

```
A BlockChain do not has a central server, it runs on 'nodes', which are devices that deploied the blockchain's system. These nodes validate and distribute transactions, as well as maintain a copy of the entire blockchain.
```

## [简答题] 智能合约是什么，有何作用？

```
Smart Contracts are programs that been deployed and executed on nodes of BlockChain. Smart Contracts can expand the functionality of its rooted base BlockChain network. With Smart Contracts, people can adapt traditional logics of Web2.0 applications into a Web3.0 way, with which the interactions and businesses can not be forged.
```

## [简答题] 怎么理解大家常说的 `EVM` 这个词汇？

```
EVM is The Ethereum Virtual Machine by definition. To some extend, it is just like Java VM or V8 engine for its ability to accomodate the code to run inside it. However, EVM is specifically designed for decentralized network, unlike JAVA VM, EVM has a storage system and other similar features built on top of the "chains", not directly on the operating system. This means that its storage and state management are maintained on the blockchain itself, rather than directly on an operating system. This allows for decentralized, transparent, and secure execution of smart contracts across the distributed network of Ethereum nodes.
```

## [分析题] 你对去中心化的理解

```
Decentralization is a way by which the interactions and businesses can be maintained and verified without relying on one single server or a set of centralized servers provided by certain entities. Decentralization ensures that every interaction is authentic and trackable. Additionally, the creator of any application running on a decentralized network cannot unilaterally modify or forge the state of the application. 
```

## [分析题] 比较区块链与传统数据库，你的看法？

```
Firstly, blockchains may resemble databases, as they both allow for storing and retrieving information. However, traditional databases store information within the control of a specific service, and even distributed databases are usually under the supervision of some hierarchical services. In contrast, blockchain stores information independently, ensuring that the data is identical across all nodes. Additionally, the decentralized nature of blockchain ensures that information is preserved safely without the risk of loss.
